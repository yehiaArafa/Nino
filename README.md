# Nino
Nino is a python tool to compare some optimization techniques in terms of performance versus time.

# Project Objectives
This project objective was to illustrate various optimization techniques using python, and test them with some benchmark tests included in a txt file among the project repo. This project was an academic assignment, a pure hard work of 3 students in alexandria university faculty of engineering, part of optimization technique course given through the year.

# Benchmark Equations
```
1) De Jong's function:
    f(x, y) = x**2+2*y**2
2) Rosenbrock’s valley:
    f(x, y) = 100*(y-x**2)**2+(1-x)**2
3) Rastrigin’s function:
    f(x, y) = 10.2+(x**2-10*cos(2*(22/7)*x))+(y**2-10*cos(2*(22/7)*y))
4) Easom’s function:
    f(x, y) =-cos(x)*cos(y)*exp(-(x-(22/7))**2-(y-(22/7))**2)
5) Branins’s function:
    f(x, y)=1*(y-((5.1/(4*(22/7)**2))*x**2)+((5/(22/7))*x)-6)**2+10*(1-(1/(8*(22/7))))*cos(x)+10
